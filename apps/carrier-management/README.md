## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** — React framework with App Router
- **Drizzle ORM** — Type-safe database access
- **SQLite** (via `@libsql/client`) — Zero-config database, no server needed
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling with Warp design tokens
- **Radix UI** — Accessible headless components
- **Zod** — Schema validation
- **Lucide** — Icon library

## Self-Hosting

This system is designed to run completely standalone with zero external dependencies.

```bash
# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/dasokolovsky/warp-tools.git
cd warp-tools
npm install

# Build for production
cd apps/carrier-management
npm run db:migrate
npm run build
npm start
# → Running on http://localhost:3001
```

The database is a local SQLite file (`carrier-management.db`). No Postgres, no cloud services, no accounts needed.

### Docker

```bash
# From the monorepo root
docker compose up carrier-management
# → Running on http://localhost:3001
```

## Data Model

```
carriers ──────────── carrier_contacts (1:many)
    │
    ├──────────────── carrier_insurance (1:many)
    │
    ├──────────────── carrier_rates (1:many)
    │
    └──────────────── carrier_performance (1:many)
```

Each carrier can have multiple contacts, insurance records, contracted rates, and performance logs. Performance scores are calculated as weighted composites of on-time pickup/delivery, damage rates, and communication scores.

## Ideas & Next Steps

Want to contribute? Here are concrete features that would make this system even better:

### 🟢 Easy (Good first issues)

- **Email notifications** — Send alerts when insurance is expiring in 30/14/7 days
- **CSV export** — Export carrier list, rates, or performance data to CSV
- **Webhook events** — Fire webhooks when carriers are added/updated/expire
- **Dark/Light theme toggle** — Currently dark-only; add light theme option
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Cmd+K` to search, `N` to add new carrier

### 🟡 Medium

- **Bulk import** — CSV upload to import carrier list from spreadsheet (most users are migrating from Excel)
- **FMCSA API integration** — Auto-lookup carrier info from MC/DOT number via [SAFER Web](https://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/)
- **Rate trend charts** — Visualize rate changes over time per lane with line/bar charts
- **Saved views** — Save filter combinations as named views ("My Top Carriers", "Expiring This Month")
- **Activity log** — Track who changed what and when (audit trail)
- **Print-friendly views** — Generate printable carrier profiles and rate sheets
- **Multi-select actions** — Select multiple carriers for bulk status change, export, or delete

### 🔴 Hard (High impact)

- **Insurance document OCR** — Upload a certificate image, auto-extract provider, coverage amounts, and dates using AI
- **SAFER API integration** — Pull safety ratings, inspection data, crash history directly from FMCSA
- **Carrier portal** — Generate a unique link for carriers to update their own info, upload insurance docs
- **Multi-tenant** — Support for multiple organizations/teams with role-based access
- **Real-time collaboration** — Multiple users editing simultaneously with conflict resolution
- **Mobile app (PWA)** — Installable progressive web app for field use
- **TMS integration** — Sync carrier data with popular TMS platforms (McLeod, TMW, MercuryGate)

### 🚀 Future Systems Integration

This system is designed to connect with other Warp Tools systems:

- **Invoice Tracker** → Link invoices to carriers, track payment history per carrier
- **Document Vault** → Store BOLs, PODs, and contracts linked to carriers
- **Dispatch** → Assign carriers to loads based on lane rates and performance scores
- **Rate Management** → RFQ workflows, automated rate sheet parsing
- **Mini TMS** → Complete shipment lifecycle with carrier at the center
