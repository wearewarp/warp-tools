## How It Works

### Detention

```
Total time on site = departure - arrival
Billable time = total time - free time (min 0)
Detention fee = billable hours × hourly rate
               (capped at daily max if set)
```

### Demurrage

```
Days held = pickup date - available date
Billable days = days held - free days (min 0)
Demurrage fee = billable days × daily rate
               OR tiered calculation if tiers are set
```

**Tiered example (port):**
- Days 1–5: $150/day
- Days 6–10: $250/day
- Days 11+: $400/day
