## How IFTA Works

IFTA (International Fuel Tax Agreement) simplifies fuel tax reporting for interstate carriers. Instead of filing separately in each state, you file **one quarterly return** with your base jurisdiction.

**The math:**
1. Calculate fleet average MPG (total miles ÷ total gallons)
2. For each state: taxable gallons = state miles ÷ fleet MPG
3. Tax owed to state = taxable gallons × state tax rate
4. Tax already paid = gallons purchased in state × state tax rate
5. Net = owed − paid (positive = you owe, negative = you get credit)

States where you drove more than you fueled → you owe.  
States where you fueled more than you drove → you get a credit.

## Tax Rate Data

- Save/load calculations to localStorage
- Add previous quarter rate history

### 🟡 Medium
- Multi-vehicle support (enter per truck, aggregate)
- Mileage import from ELD/GPS CSV files
- Province-level Canadian rates (currently using USD equivalents)

### 🔴 Hard
- Integration with Load Dispatch (auto-pull trip mileage)
- AI route parser (paste a route, auto-split by state)
- Direct IFTA filing integration
