## Data Model

Six tables, all SQLite via Drizzle ORM:

```
customers
  └─ id (PK), name, billing_contact, email, phone, address
     payment_terms (net_15|net_30|net_45|net_60|quick_pay|factored)
     credit_limit, notes, status (active|inactive|on_hold)

invoices
  └─ id (PK), invoice_number (unique), customer_id → customers
     load_ref, status (draft|sent|partially_paid|paid|overdue|void)
     invoice_date, due_date, subtotal, tax_amount, total, amount_paid, notes

invoice_line_items
  └─ id (PK), invoice_id → invoices (cascade delete)
     description, quantity, unit_price, amount
     line_type (freight|fuel_surcharge|detention|accessorial|lumper|other)

payments_received
  └─ id (PK), invoice_id → invoices (cascade delete)
     amount, payment_date
     payment_method (ach|wire|check|credit_card|factoring|other)
     reference_number, notes

carrier_payments
  └─ id (PK), carrier_id, carrier_name, load_ref
     amount, pay_type (standard|quick_pay|hold)
     quick_pay_discount, net_amount
     status (pending|approved|paid|disputed)
     scheduled_date, paid_date, reference_number, notes

loads
  └─ id (PK), load_ref (unique), customer_id → customers
     carrier_id, carrier_name, revenue, cost
     invoice_id → invoices (nullable), carrier_payment_id → carrier_payments (nullable)
     status (booked|in_transit|delivered|invoiced|paid|cancelled)
     pickup_date, delivery_date, origin, destination, notes
```

**Key relationships:**
- A `load` links one customer invoice and one carrier payment, enabling per-load margin tracking
- `invoice_line_items` and `payments_received` cascade-delete with their parent invoice
- Margin = `loads.revenue - loads.cost` (computed, not stored)

## Ideas & Next Steps

### 🟢 Easy
- Add CSV export for invoice list
- Add "Send Reminder" email template for overdue invoices
- Add invoice number auto-increment from settings
- Dark/light theme toggle

### 🟡 Medium
- PDF invoice generation with company branding
- QuickBooks CSV import/export
- Recurring invoices (monthly retainers)
- Customer payment history charts
- Factoring integration workflow

### 🔴 Hard
- Integration with Carrier Management (pull carrier data directly)
- Multi-currency support
- Automated overdue notifications (cron + email)
- Accounting journal entries (double-entry bookkeeping)
