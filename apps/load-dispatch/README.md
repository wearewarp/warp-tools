## Ideas & Next Steps
### 🟢 Easy
- Add load count per customer on dashboard
- Color-code margin on kanban cards
- Add "quick status" buttons on table rows
- Export loads to CSV

### 🟡 Medium
- Drag-and-drop Kanban board
- Map view of active loads (Mapbox/Leaflet)
- SMS check call reminders (Twilio)
- Automated overdue notifications
- Multi-stop loads (pickup at A, deliver to B and C)

### 🔴 Hard
- Integration with Carrier Management (auto-suggest carriers by lane/equipment match)
- Integration with Invoice Tracker (auto-create invoice on "Mark Invoiced")
- Integration with Document Vault (attach BOL/POD to loads)
- Real-time tracking via ELD/GPS integration
- Mobile app for drivers (check call updates)
